**There is such a legend: every weekend, Jeff Dean, the lead of google ai, will sit on the same computer with his friend Sanjay to write programs.**


**Yes, it seems weird, but I know a lot of people in the industry do this with their buddies, but wouldn't it be nice if two people couldn't meet, or they had to deal with two people fighting over a computer** **so awkward.**


**So I want to develop a network compiler. This compiler can be edited at the same time like a Google cloud document. It can be run on one person's computer as the host and displayed on everyone's computer. It has a communication function and can video chat. From then on** **, At the same time, writing programs can be done even if they are thousands of miles apart.**
